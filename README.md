Hello, my first assignment, the authorization application. The source code is in the file "autorization.c", written in gedit. The compiled file is autorization. You first need to get its compiler, which can be installed through the installation of the build-essential development package. To install this package, launch the terminal and issue the following command:
"sudo apt install build-essential"
Compile the code via the command provided below:
"gcc -Wall -o autorization autorization.c"
To obtain the output of the program, type the filename in the terminal:
"./autorization"
